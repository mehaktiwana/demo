## YouTube Data Analytics Channel Analysis (Jupyter Notebook)

This project utilizes the YouTube Data API to gather data about popular Data Analytics channels and analyze their metrics within a Jupyter Notebook.

### Project Goals

*  Collect data on various Data Analytics channels using the YouTube Data API.
*  Analyze channel statistics such as view count, subscriber count, like count, and more.
*  Identify the most viewed, liked, and subscribed-to Data Analytics channels.

### Setup

1. **Create a YouTube Data API Project:** Follow the official guide to create a project and obtain API credentials: [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. **Install Jupyter Notebook:** If you don't have it already, install Jupyter Notebook using `pip install jupyter` or your preferred package manager.

###  Running the Project

1. **Configure API Key:**  Store your YouTube Data API key securely (not within this readme) and use a code cell within the notebook to authenticate API requests.
2. **Open the Notebook:** Use `jupyter notebook` in your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the notebook file (e.g., `youtube_analysis.ipynb`). 
3. **Run the Cells:** Execute the code cells within the notebook sequentially (usually top-down) to perform data retrieval, analysis, and generate output.

### Expected Output

The output will be displayed within the notebook itself. You might see:

* A list of the most viewed, liked, and subscribed-to Data Analytics channels.
* Data visualizations showcasing trends in channel metrics.
* Insights or reports based on the data analysis.
